    "Refactor this python code so in arram boyle mode the code creates a polygonarcgroup object containing the entire closed area outline formed by arcs. I later want to use that to clip a background I want to fill into the arc. For now just refactor without background while keeping all functionality the same. The issue is the arcs from one circle will be in different groups and multiple times in multiple groups. So best would be to go over all arcs and recognize arcs where the ends intersect (with a error margin) and a circle of such arcs is an enclosed area. Only arc groups of length 8 are relevant. You can use the fact constructing it that each arc group consists of the four arcs kept from each circle. And then one arc each from the neighbouring two circles above and below. Implement it elegantly, readable and object oriented, possibly extending existing classes. Now the creation of the arc groups I will do manually, please prepare the code for this. I will do it via circle properties. I need to be able to access a circles 6 neighbour circles and the arcs to match the arcs to a group properly. "
